Face Recognition App

Here, users can post any image link from the internet. If the face recognition api detects a face, it will place a blue rectangle around it.

How It's Made: Tech used: REACT, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MongoDB, Express

This app was created using the MERN stack, usernames and passwords are saved under the user collection on MongoDB (passwords saved with bcrypt). Images used to detect faces are direct image links, not files.

Optimizations:
I would like for there to be a ranking system for users, something simple as every submission adding a point to their profile. Then users could compare their scores with one another to see how many submissions they have had.

Lessons Learned: 
Being able to implmement the face recognition api into my project was a great learning experience.
